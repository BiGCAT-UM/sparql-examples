# Maastricht University - Dept&nbsp;of&nbsp;Translational&nbsp;Genomics

We collect the SPARQL examples in different formats,
for different projects of the Dept&nbsp;of&nbsp;Translational&nbsp;Genomics
at Maastricht University where we have a public SPARQL endpoint.

In this GitHub pages we have a HTML rendering for a growing number of them.

 * [AOP-Wiki](./examples/AOPWiki/)
 * [ChEMBL](./examples/ChEMBL/)
 * [VHP4Safety](./examples/VHP4Safety/)
 * [WikiPathways](./examples/WikiPathways/)

Futhermore, we have collected many SPARQL queries around Wikidata, some of which are listed here:

 * [Citation Typing Ontology](./examples/Wikdiata - CiTO/)
 * [Scholia](./examples/Scholia/)

This repository is based on the work by the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/),
and specifically [this website repository](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples) and
[this utils repository](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples-utils/).
